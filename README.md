# WebGL VR Editor

This is a simple voxel editor for [Google Cardboard](https://store.google.com/product/google_cardboard) and the iPhone.
Open https://evanw.github.io/webgl-vr-editor/ in Safari, rotate the phone 90 degrees to put it in the headset, and tap the headset button to use the current menu selection (the menu is at the bottom of the screen).
